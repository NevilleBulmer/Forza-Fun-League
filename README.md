# Forza-Fun-League
Semi professional racing league contact application.


Forza fun league was an application I developed which was to be utilized by a semi professional racing team within forza motorsport the game, its primary purpose was to be an all-in-one application where all teammates could converse and get updates on racing schedules, events, and sponsorships.

Its features include:

*	Sing up.
*	Login.
*	Password reset.
*	Friends list.
*	Add / remove friends.
*	Timeline functionality.
*	Fully customizable push notifications (admin access).
*	Customizable account types.

The application was deployed to google play store where it is still available and is used every day, it was developed using react native, Java and Firebase for facilitating a database connection.

The database connection is handled using a RESTful API developed using python and following a singleton pattern, this API handles everything from inserting, updating, retrieving and the deletion of information.

The API was developed using python primarily with speed of operations in mind.

The API is under NDA so is not publishable at this time.
